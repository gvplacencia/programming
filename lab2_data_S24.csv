015869477,1,74,38,3,0,4,2,"I felt that the first task was more difficult because it required me to think before i started to write, the other one didn't make me do that it became almost automatic"
014391117,1,69,35,1,1,4,1,It does require more thought in writing each character.
015128607,,59.19,34.25,1,1,4,1,"For task 1, there were too many things to keep track of. Keeping track of the letters and what number I was on kept getting me stuck. Task 2 was simple, only needing to focus on one task at a time."
14496066,1,60.92,31.4,0,0,4,1,I had to take a moment to think and realize where I was in the sentence and numerical order for task 1.  Whereas task 2 felt fluid and natural.  
015292602,1,54.03,35.29,2,0,4,1,Task 1 felt more difficult because of the switching between the letters and numbers while in Task 2 there was no switching and was more focus on writing each line.
015667782,2,48,31,0,0,3,2,Task 1 felt more difficult because you constantly had to keep switching from one row to the other.
016933566,,56.79,33.17,0,0,4,2,Task 1 seemed more difficult because my mind was preoccupied with 2 things at once while task 2 allowed me to do one task at a time which was easier.

014637350,1,95,38,1,0,2,1,Task one was more difficult because of the continuous task switching.
013717782,2,69,34,3,2,4,1,It was harder for me to focus on both tasks at the same time. It felt very natural and easy when I did one task at a time.
015727049,1,47,27,2,0,3,1,Task 1 felt more difficult than task 2 because I had to juggle between letters and numbers while also completing the sentence. Task 1 was more complex than Task 2. Task 2 was a straight forward task. 
016199469,1,55,35,0,2,4,2,Task 1 seemed more difficult than task 2 because switching back and forth from writing to numbering would overload me and often times have me scrambling around. 
015466464,1,50,27,1,0,3,1,"Task 2 was very easy because that is just the natural way of writing out words and numbers.
For Task 1 I kept losing track on where I was for writing out the sentence. I also just wanted to finish the words. "
013052078,1,61.46,29.23,1,1,4,3,The first task felt more difficult because you are interchanging between writing a letter and a number on top of trying to be as fast as possible and be as neat as possible without having to make any errors.
015650258,,57.51,28.21,0,0,5,2,I wanted to write more of the letters and/or numbers at once rather than interchanging. I also lost track of what letters I had next in the phrase.
014573962,1,71.23,35.22,2,0,4,3,"During task 1, I had to go back and forth between my thought processes. Recalling and writing alternating two different patterns was difficult."
015931708,2,65,36,1,0,4,2,2 was writing things one at a time which felt for efficient than the first.

014362699,2,81.88,39.96,0,0,4,2,You had to focus hard on two different tasks and try to make no errors and switch off really quickly
016498677,3,63,25,0,0,3,2,This is because my attention is distracted between the two task of writing the letter and number
015838251,1,60,26,1,0,4,2,"When doing task one, I was talking in my head as I was writing, and numbers would pop in instead of the letter I needed."
016048032,1,106,36,1,0,5,1,unable to focus on one thing at a time and i had to move my hand more

015502318,1,83,37,0,0,4,2,"For Task 1 it felt very uncomfortable to get use to. The motions of jumping back and forth between letters and numbers makes me think about the alphabet (A-1, B-2, C-3, etc). I wanted to assign the letter to the appropriate number. For Task 2 it was much more easier. Writing out the entire phrase was less of a hassle. With the numbers it was breeze to go through since it was a standard numerical pattern.  "
017320030,1,71.28,31.16,2,0,4,1,Because task 1 required more shift between letter and number concept to write
015114541,1,65,38,0,0,4,5,Task 2 felt more difficult than Task 1 even though it should have been easier with the reason being that the brain is still switching from first task to the second task.
