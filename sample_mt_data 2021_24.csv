1/31/2024 15:37,14391117,1,69,35,1,1,4,1,It does require more thought in writing each character.
1/31/2024 15:37,15128607,,59.19,34.25,1,1,4,1,"For task 1, there were too many things to keep track of. Keeping track of the letters and what number I was on kept getting me stuck. Task 2 was simple, only needing to focus on one task at a time."
1/31/2024 15:37,14496066,1,60.92,31.4,0,0,4,1,I had to take a moment to think and realize where I was in the sentence and numerical order for task 1.  Whereas task 2 felt fluid and natural.  
1/31/2024 15:38,15292602,1,54.03,35.29,2,0,4,1,Task 1 felt more difficult because of the switching between the letters and numbers while in Task 2 there was no switching and was more focus on writing each line.
1/31/2024 15:40,15667782,2,48,31,0,0,3,2,Task 1 felt more difficult because you constantly had to keep switching from one row to the other.
1/31/2024 15:40,16933566,,56.79,33.17,0,0,4,2,Task 1 seemed more difficult because my mind was preoccupied with 2 things at once while task 2 allowed me to do one task at a time which was easier.
1/31/2024 15:40,17221035,1,59.23,33.63,1,0,2,1,Task 1 requires my hand to travel more and something thinking at times when starting or ending a word.
1/31/2024 15:42,17156178,1,48,26,0,0,4,1,"Task 1 was more difficult because you had to remember to properly spell each word in the phrase, and still remembering the number you were on."
1/31/2024 15:42,14637350,1,95,38,1,0,2,1,Task one was more difficult because of the continuous task switching.
1/31/2024 15:43,13717782,2,69,34,3,2,4,1,It was harder for me to focus on both tasks at the same time. It felt very natural and easy when I did one task at a time.
1/31/2024 15:44,15727049,1,47,27,2,0,3,1,Task 1 felt more difficult than task 2 because I had to juggle between letters and numbers while also completing the sentence. Task 1 was more complex than Task 2. Task 2 was a straight forward task. 
1/31/2024 15:45,16199469,1,55,35,0,2,4,2,Task 1 seemed more difficult than task 2 because switching back and forth from writing to numbering would overload me and often times have me scrambling around. 
1/31/2024 15:45,15466464,1,50,27,1,0,3,1,"Task 2 was very easy because that is just the natural way of writing out words and numbers.
For Task 1 I kept losing track on where I was for writing out the sentence. I also just wanted to finish the words. "
1/31/2024 15:48,13052078,1,61.46,29.23,1,1,4,3,The first task felt more difficult because you are interchanging between writing a letter and a number on top of trying to be as fast as possible and be as neat as possible without having to make any errors.
1/31/2024 15:48,15650258,,57.51,28.21,0,0,5,2,I wanted to write more of the letters and/or numbers at once rather than interchanging. I also lost track of what letters I had next in the phrase.
1/31/2024 15:49,14573962,1,71.23,35.22,2,0,4,3,"During task 1, I had to go back and forth between my thought processes. Recalling and writing alternating two different patterns was difficult."
1/31/2024 15:49,15931708,2,65,36,1,0,4,2,2 was writing things one at a time which felt for efficient than the first.

1/31/2024 15:49,16223363,1,44.27,26.54,0,1,4,2,The first task require good rymthm and having the next character in your mind as your writing.
1/31/2024 15:49,15360202,1,66,33,0,0,4,1,Task 1 felt more difficult than the other because it was distracting due to going to different positions and going back and forth from the letters and numbers row.

1/31/2024 15:51,16498677,3,63,25,0,0,3,2,This is because my attention is distracted between the two task of writing the letter and number

1/31/2024 15:53,16048032,1,106,36,1,0,5,1,unable to focus on one thing at a time and i had to move my hand more
1/31/2024 15:53,15530151,1,70,25,0,0,3,2,The second task was much easier than the second one because it required less concentration then doing numbers and letters at the same time.
1/31/2024 15:54,9734985,1,75.43,32.09,4,0,4,2,Task 1 seemed more difficult as my workflow was constantly being interrupted. 
1/31/2024 15:55,15502318,1,83,37,0,0,4,2,"For Task 1 it felt very uncomfortable to get use to. The motions of jumping back and forth between letters and numbers makes me think about the alphabet (A-1, B-2, C-3, etc). I wanted to assign the letter to the appropriate number. For Task 2 it was much more easier. Writing out the entire phrase was less of a hassle. With the numbers it was breeze to go through since it was a standard numerical pattern.  "
1/31/2024 15:57,17320030,1,71.28,31.16,2,0,4,1,Because task 1 required more shift between letter and number concept to write
1/31/2024 16:08,15114541,1,65,38,0,0,4,5,Task 2 felt more difficult than Task 1 even though it should have been easier with the reason being that the brain is still switching from first task to the second task.
